The #terminal, also known as the command line or shell, is a text-based interface to interact with your computer.

The last line in #terminal is called the #prompt. It typically ends with a `$` symbol. This is where you'll type your commands.

`$` обозначает обычного пользователя в оболочках Bash, Bourne или Korn.
